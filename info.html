        ABOUT JENNIE <br>

        ”I want the listener to feel like every song creates a movie inside their heads…”
    </h2>

    <p>
        From her solo debut in 2007, Jennie Abrahamson has developed a sound that has evolved record by record;
        music
        with the ability to evoke clear images in warm colours, that mediates exact feelings; songs from different
        perspectives, that tie together personal experiences and unvarnished reflections with sharp observations of
        the
        surrounding world.

        She started out young in the northern Swedish trip hop band Heed, who released two albums on EMI. When
        kicking
        off her solo career with the firstling ”Lights” in 2007, she founded her own label and has worked
        independently
        ever since. While ”Lights” dealt with changes and goodbyes, her critically acclaimed sophomore ”While the
        sun’s
        still up and the sky is bright” (2009) was a New York love story that was released in all of Europe and put
        her
        on the map outside of Sweden.
        <br> <br>
        ”The sound of your beating heart”, with the hit ”Hard to come by”, was released in 2011, and she toured
        extensively. Upon homecoming, she started wondering if there was anything besides or beyond music she wanted
        to
        do. She took a break to start studies in psychology, but in the summer of 2012 she was recruited to be part
        of
        her childhood idol Peter Gabriel’s touring band for the anniversary of his album ”SO” (Jennie’s favorite)
        and
        felt like that surreal event was like the universe pulling her back into music. She did 5 arena tours
        throughout
        the world as part of Gabriel’s band and as supporting act, the last one a co-headline with Sting.
        <br> <br>
        During her time with Gabriel she released ”Gemini gemini” (2014), an explorative album that rendered her an
        ”Indie of the Year” award at Manifest (Swedish independent grammy’s) and was nominated by IMPALA for the
        European Indie Album of the Year Award – as the only swede. It made the critic’s collected top 10 for that
        year,
        and she once again toured extensively throughout Europe with her band, and also brought them along for the
        journey of recording the next album.
        <br> <br>
        In 2017 she was back with Reverseries, a stunning ten track collection of unique, ethereal pop songs that
        deal
        with intimacy, relationships, humanity and love; an emotive, interpersonal compendium of issues close to the
        heart. The album was met with raving reviews and a nomination, among other accolades, for Pop of the Year at
        P3
        Guld, a Swedish national public radio award.
        <br> <br>
        Since then, she has – among other things – toured both solo and with her band, been part of a few different
        symphonic orchestra projects, sung at the Polar Prize Ceremony, had a composition residence that ended up in
        a
        directed concert – ”Kärlek & Makt” with one hour of music in Swedish, and more. Over the years, she has
        continued to tour as a musician with other artists and bands. Over the years she has worked with artists
        such as
        Ane Brun, Peter Bjorn & John, Loney dear, Deportees and Mattias Risberg MINING.
        <br> <br>
        2022 sees Jennie release the music from her concert play ”Kärlek & Makt”, and begin recording the follow-up
        to
        ”Reverseries”.
